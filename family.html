<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> My beloved family</p>

<div class="layout">
    <p> The picture above taken during a graduation ceremony of my second brother located in <abbr title="Politeknik Ungku Omar">PUO</abbr>, Ipoh, Perak.
        Introducing to you each one of my family members started from left - my eldest brother, mom, youngest brother, second brother, dad and obviously
        me. Six family members checked &#10004;. When it comes to the family, all I can say, they mean so much to me. They are those people who inspire 
        me in any particular things and that's what makes them so precious in my life. Despite the small fights, annoying moment, teasing and love-hate
        relationship between siblings, I still love them (read: when they spend their money on me especially foOd).</p>

    <p> Basically, both of my parents from Kelantan and this is the plus point for us to be multilingual I guess. All of us usually spend our time together 
        by watching movies and variety shows. This is also the time when we exchange our thoughts, ideas and many more. It sounds cliche, but I think spending 
        time like this is really important to strengthen relationship between family members. Sometimes, in the middle of the movie showtimes, my parents will
        suddenly sharing their own stories back when they were young. They somehow want to highlight their experience just like the movie shown. Back then, I
        always thought it was amusing since I found their stories not really relatable as the movie but yeah, let's just nod and give them some reaction &#128514;. 
        Nevertheless, as I've grow up, I realize that the moment was actually special. Really special.</p>
